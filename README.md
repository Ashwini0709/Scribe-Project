# Scribe-Project

Scribe is a minimalist Python program that brings a Cartesian grid to life in the terminal. A single dot moves across the grid, sketching shapes like squares, wavy lines, or diagonals based on programmed patterns. As the dot travels, the terminal displays its path, creating simple yet striking designs. Perfect for exploring coordinate geometry or enjoying text-based art, Scribe turns code into a digital doodle, drawing one step at a time.

## Key Features:

- A dot automatically traces shapes on a text-based Cartesian grid.
- Creates patterns like squares, waves, or lines without user input.
- Displays the dotâ€™s path in real-time in the terminal.
- Lightweight, using only Python for easy setup.
  
##Technologies: Pure Python, terminal-based interface.
